# React Native Demo
I wanted to try React Native for few hours.

## How To Run
 - git clone https://github.com/dcampogiani/React-Native-Demo.git
 - cd React-Native-Demo
 - npm install
 - react-native run-android or react-native run-ios


## Android Demo

## iOS Demo

## Limitations
At the moment I've hardcoded Bologna latitude and longitude, I should use device GPS and this demo will work worldwide.
